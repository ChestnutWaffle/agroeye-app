Unlike peach leaf curl, treatments for scab made when trees are completely dormant aren't effective and aren't recommended.\n\nIf treatments are needed, the generally recommended time is between when buds begin to break and a month after petal fall.\n\nIf rain threatens, it is important to apply a fungicide as soon as you see the tips of the leaves emerge.\n\nA second application might be needed 10 to 14 days later if it is still rainy, once you can see blossom clusters but before they have opened.\n\nIf rainy weather continues, apply a third spray toward the end of the bloom period, when most of the petals have fallen.\n\nThe surfaces of the fruit and foliage become more resistant to infection as the season progresses, although extended wet, foggy weather can lead to an infection period due to secondary spores that develop on leaves and fruit.\n\nIf no scab infections are evident 1 month after petal fall, secondary infections probably won't be a problem, and fungicide sprays can stop.\n\nHowever, continue to watch for pinpoint scab symptoms, especially if late rains occur.\n\nSeveral fungicides are available for controlling apple and pear scab.
